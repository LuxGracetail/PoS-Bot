# PS-Roleplaying-Bot-2

This is a Pokémon Showdown bot fully written in ES6+ JavaScript using Babel.
Unlike other Pokémon Showdown bots out there written in JavaScript, this allows
running several bots from a single parent process to allow running bots on
multiple servers, for instance.

Instructions
============

If you don't know what you're doing, don't use this bot. To install
dependencies, run `npm install`. After copying config-example.js to config.js
and configuring each of the bots you'd like to run, run `npm start` to
build the source code and spawn them.
